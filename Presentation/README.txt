For this presentation we chose to concentrate on hand rehabilitation and the project we focused on is the following:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320283281_Design_and_Preliminary_Feasibility_Study_of_a_Soft_Robotic_Glove_for_Hand_Function_Assistance_in_Stroke_Survivors

Since we all found soft robotics very fascinating, we want to share with you some of the links that we read to prepare this presentation, even if in the end we chose the previously mentioned one.
